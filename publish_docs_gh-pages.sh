# Publish a pre-built static site (HTML/plots) to GitHub Pages without committing
# build artifacts to your main repo history.
#
# OVERVIEW
# --------
# - You run your heavy pipeline locally/cluster and it produces web-ready files in a
#   directory (default: ./results/docs relative to your *current working directory*).
# - This script publishes that directory to a dedicated Pages branch as a single
#   force-pushed snapshot commit with no parent, so the Pages branch ALWAYS contains
#   exactly one commit and your main branch and history stay clean.
# - Configure GitHub Pages to serve from: Settings -> Pages -> "Deploy from a branch"
#   -> Branch: (the Pages branch, default: gh-pages), Folder: /.
#
# HOW THE SNAPSHOT IS BUILT
# -------------------------
# The site is read where it already sits; it is never copied. `git` is pointed at the
# site directory as its work tree and told to stage it into a temporary index, and the
# resulting tree is committed and pushed directly:
#
#   git --work-tree=<site> add --all --force .   (into GIT_INDEX_FILE=<temp index>)
#   git write-tree                               -> tree of exactly the site's files
#   git commit-tree <tree>                       -> commit with no parent
#   git push -f <remote> <commit>:<pages branch>
#
# Consequences worth knowing:
# - The only temporary artifact is that index (tens of KB), written inside the git
#   directory so that the repository's own filesystem is the only one needing free
#   space. A site of any size needs no scratch space, and TMPDIR is not used.
# - `--all --force` is deliberate. With the work tree redirected to the site directory
#   the repository's top-level .gitignore is not consulted, but $GIT_DIR/info/exclude
#   and core.excludesFile still are, and those must not be able to silently drop files
#   out of the published site.
# - The tree is built from scratch every run, so the snapshot is exact: a file deleted
#   from the site directory disappears from the published branch.
# - No local branch is created or deleted, and no worktree is added; the commit is
#   pushed by object name. Your refs are left exactly as they were.
# - The blobs are written into the repository's object store, as any commit's are. Each
#   publish supersedes the last, so the previous snapshot's objects become unreachable
#   and accumulate locally; `git gc --prune=now` reclaims them. They are never pushed:
#   `git push` sends only objects reachable from the ref being pushed.
#
# SAFETY / STRICT MODE
# --------------------
# - We use `set -Eeuo pipefail`:
#     - -E: traps propagate through functions/subshells
#     - -e: exit on any non-zero command
#     - -u: treat unset vars as errors
#     - -o pipefail: pipelines fail if *any* command fails
# - We narrow IFS and install traps so the temporary index is removed on exit. SIGKILL
#   cannot be trapped; a leftover index is tens of KB inside the git directory, and a
#   stale one is swept at the start of the next run.
# - The push is a force-push, so the script refuses to run unless the staged snapshot
#   has a top-level index.html, rather than replacing a live site with nothing.
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   ./publish_docs_gh-pages.sh
#
# Examples:
#   PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_SITE_DIR=out/site \
#   PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_BRANCH=gh-pages \
#   PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_REMOTE=origin \
#     ./publish_docs_gh-pages.sh
#
# ENV / ARGS
# ----------
# - PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_SITE_DIR  (default: results/docs; **relative to caller's CWD**)
#   Must contain a top-level index.html
# - PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_BRANCH    (default: gh-pages)
# - PUBLISH_DOCS_GH_PAGES_REMOTE    (default: origin)
#
# REQUIREMENTS
# ------------
# - Run from *inside* your Git repo (any subdirectory is fine).
# - `git` >= 2.13 (for `rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`). No other tools are needed.
# - Push access to the remote.
# - Keep within GitHub Pages practical limits (site <= ~1 GB; single file <100 MB).
